# Vanilla-Javascript

In these files, we are covering three different ways of using javascript code in an HTML file.
The first method is using <script> tag inside the <head> tag.
The second method is using <script> tag inside the <body> tag.
The third method is using <script src=""> and linking an external javascript file inside the src="main.js".
